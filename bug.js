This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized.  This often happens within a component's render method before `useEffect` or `componentDidMount` have had a chance to update the state.

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing 'data' before it's fetched
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* This will cause an error if data is null */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
